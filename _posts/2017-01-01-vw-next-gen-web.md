# Project abstract
subheader: >-
    Volkswagen wanted to update their digital showroom and asked us explore visionary design concepts. The team focused on improving navigation, conversion and on creating more engaging content. For this project I designed various interactive prototypes and motion concepts, which we used for user-testing and idea validation. Our work aimed towards mobile web visitors, who do not want to spend a lot time searching or comparing cars while on the go. Instead of presenting tons of detailled information, we reduced complexity whereever we could and explored a format similar towards social-media stories.
