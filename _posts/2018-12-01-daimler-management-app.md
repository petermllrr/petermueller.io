Initial Workshop
----------------

The project was kicked-off with a full day workshop for the product owners from Daimler and the complete design team. The POs and the designers wanted to understand the full scope of requirements and user needs. The workshop helped the team as well to understand dependencies and technical limitations of the internal technical IT landscape at Daimler. We finished with an agreed sprint plan, a rough first sitemap and a set of user stories we based our work on.
