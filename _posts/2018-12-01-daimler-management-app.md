Initial Workshop
----------------

The project was kicked-off with a full day workshop for the product owners and the complete design team. The POs and the designers wanted to understand the full scope of requirements and user needs. The workshop helped the team as well to understand dependencies and technical limitations of the internal technical IT landscape. We finished with an agreed sprint plan, a rough first sitemap and a set of user stories we based our work on.

Concept
-------

The Management App is a data and microservice aggregator. It helps executives to access relevant data about her or his department faster by connecting to multiple internal systems and retrieving data automatically. Information is always up-to-date and each user only sees information relevant for her or his department. The first iteration of the app focuses on employee and hiring data.

Apart from data aggregation, the Management App also includes useful microservices like editing the user's company profile, receiving urgent system notifications and displaying an overview of the user's tasks.
