      text: >-
        I am focussing on interface design, interactive prototyping, and organizing design teams and projects. While UI design keeps me busy most of the day, I also create illustrations in 2D or 3D, and code prototypes and simple websites. Because most of my projects are being actively developed, I have a good understanding of agile methodologies like Scrum and how to run design teams in such an environment.

        For more than seven years I have been working for a wide range of clients from the automotive, energy and retail sector. Examples include Daimler, Mercedes-Benz, EnBW, Bosch, VW, Wüstenrot, and IQOS.
