Case study structure
--------------------

1. The abstract is a simple value proposition statement / ad-lib
2. First paragraph should describe the project kick-off and first steps. A workshop? What situation did you start with?
3. Make sections for every main sub-project like infographics, icons, design system
4. Summarize screenshots in a "Screenshots" section
5. Add funny team pictures at the end for impressions :)
